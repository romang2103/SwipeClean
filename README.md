# SwipeClean
SwipeClean is a simple app used to improve the experience of deleting photos (currently on iOS only)

This is an experimental app I am building in an attempt to learn how to use react native to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android devices.

How the app currently works:
- Upon opening the app you are prompted to by the app to allow access to your photo gallery
- Once permission is granted a random photo chosen from the photo gallery will be loaded onto the screen
- The user will then have (currently) 2 options to choose from
- 1) Swipe left to view a new randomly selected photo that hasn't been shown yet
- 2) Swipe right to delete the current photo which is then replaced by a new random photo from your gallery that hasn't been shown yet 

Future plans:
- Make the app work on Android devices
- Add an upswipe action that could allow for moving the photo into a predetermined album (e.g. upswipe will move the photo to favourites/other album of choice)
- Add a zoom feature for users to be able to zoom into photos
- Add a score/counter at the top of the app (e.g. 10 photos removed today/this week/this month) or (e.g. Total photos: 9999)
- Possibly adding videos
